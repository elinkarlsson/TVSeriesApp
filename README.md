**Time spent**
Since this was my first project that I built in React Native, it took me some extra time to learn the basics and to set up the app.

I used Expo at first because it was very easy and fast to get up and running, but after a while I changed to the React Native CLI and followed React Natives official guide. 

Learning and setup of React Native + Android Studios + Xcode etc. took around 10 hours. 

Building the App took around 5 hours.

Total time spent: around 15 hours.
